  <h2> About me </h2> 
  <div class="img">
  <p> I was born and raised in the Portland area, I grew up in Canby and went to High school in Beaverton. I attended Portland Community college for a couple years but did not complete my schooling. I then went on to work with at risk adults in a controlled environment. After many years of service work I decided that it was time for me to change career fields. I have multiple dogs and a beautiful girlfriend. We have been together almost six years. I have always been interested in computer programming. I believe that with hard work and commitment I will become a great programmer.  </p>
